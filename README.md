# Movie-Recommendations
Content Filtering via NLP

This is a movie recommendation system that uses natural language processing to find similarities between movies based on their cast, director, genre, and plot. 
The model can be run on any IDLE or in Jupyter by typing "recommend('name_of_movie')" and view the top 10 recommendations. 
The dataset used by me is called IMDB top 250 Eng movies, and the link is included in the file. However, it is of course applicable on any other dataset as well.
